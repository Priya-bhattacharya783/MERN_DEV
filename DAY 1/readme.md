🗓️ Day 1 – JavaScript for Backend (Must-know)

Focus only on backend-relevant JS:

var vs let vs const

Arrow functions

Destructuring

Spread / Rest operators

Array methods: map, filter, reduce

Callbacks, Promises, async/await

try/catch

require vs import

👉 Practice: write small async functions, Promise chains
